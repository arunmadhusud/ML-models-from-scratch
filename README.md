# ML-models-from-scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models from scratch using PyTorch. The models are implemented in a modular way, so that they can be easily used in other projects. Following models are implemented:

1. Tiny NerF (Neural Radiance Fields)
2. PointNet
3. Visual Transformer (ViT)
4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
5. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
